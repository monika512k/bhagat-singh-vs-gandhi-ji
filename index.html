  <a name="Debate on gandhi ji's role"><b><h2><u>Debate on gandhiji's role?</u></h2></b></a>
  <p>The issue of mahatma gandhi's attitude to bhagat singh's trail and execution has sparked much controversy among historians and writers. some writers allege that gandhi could have saved bhagat singh's life if he had wished,  but regrettably, he didn't and whouldn't, and  his failure in saving bhagat singh's life  from the gallows leaves a black spot on his political career . on the other hand, gandhi ji's own party workers, follower and some writers clarify with pathetic  earnestness that gandhi failed not because of his lack of interest in the well-being of bhagat singh but because of the conditioning circumstance which lay beyon his controls. I think that his controversy, which has stimulated much letrature on the subject, needs further clarity and understanding.</p>
  <p>let us first see how historians and other writers:- this is not an enumeration, but an examplification:- view and explain gandhi ji attitude to trial and execution of bhagat singh.</p>
  <p>In his biography of bhagat singh, kuldip nayar holds the view that gandhi ji was very concernd about  bhagat singh but he did not approve his violent method because he thought that such means whould not do much harm to the country</p>
  <ol type="1">
      <li>That is why  gandhi even refused to associate himself with the move to raise a statue in honour of bhagat singh's martyrdom.</li>
      <li>S.R bakshi maintains in his study that gandhi made some effort to save bhagat singh's life, but he did not put sufficient pressure on the viceroy lord irwin to commute his life sentence . bakshi thinks that a higher political pressure  would have resolved the issue in favour of the revolutionary youth.</li>
      <li>But he does not elaborate on the kind of political pressure thta would have worked! In this artical ' bhagat singh , bose and the mahatma', ashok celly castigates gandhi for not rescuing  bhagat singh from  his execution because of ' his  pathological dislike  or fear of revolution' and his commitment to non-violence .</li>

  <h2><b>purpose</b></h2>
  <p>On 13th April 1919, on the day of Baisakhi, around 10,000 people, including men, women, and children, had gathered at Jallianwala Bagh to protest against the Rowlatt act. General Dyer was in charge of Amritsar at that time; he blocked the only exit to the garden so that no one could escape. And ordered his army to fire at the people protesting there openly. Helpless Indian protestors were, they ran for life, but there was no place to run. Some of them even jumped into the well in the garden to save their life. More than 350 people lost their lives, and more than one thousand got injured. It was one of the deadliest massacres in the history of India. Bhagat Singh was 13 years old when he learned of this incident and got highly disturbed.</p>
  <p>The next day he was not in school because he went to Jallianwala Bagh on Amritsar. There he found the soil of that garden soaked with the blood of innocent Indians. He collected that soil wet with blood and stored it in a jar. When he returned home, he worshipped that soil with flowers.</p>
  <p>By the age of 16, he had seen enough suffering of Indians that he had made it a strong purpose to devote his life to the freedom of India.</p>
  <p>He was born on 27th September 1907, and his father and uncle were freedom fighters. His father’s teachings also influenced him to work for the nation, and fighting for the freedom of India became his purpose. This strong purpose helped him later take courageous steps and make sacrifices which shook the whole country. Bhagat Singh is an example of how brave you become when you have a solid and definite purpose. This is one of the most inspiring lessons from Bhagat Singh’s life.</p>
  <h2><b>sacrifice</b> </h2>
  <p>When he was 17, in 1924, his family wanted him to get married. But Bhagat Singh had devoted his life to the nation, and he knew there would be many adversaries and dangers to his life. He didn’t want to leave a widow. So, he chose not to marry. But he could not make his family understand this, so he finally left his home and came to Kanpur to fight for freedom.</p>
  <p>Bhagat Singh became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association in 1924, and here he met Chandra Sekhar Azad and became close friends. HRA was a revolutionary organization that fought against British colonial rule in India. This organization was later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). Here Bhagat Singh took many steps to oppose British colonial rule in India. Of them, the biggest was throwing bombs on the central assembly hall in 1929.</p>
  <p>On 8th April 1929, Bhagat Singh and BK Dutt threw two bombs in the assembly hall. They surrendered themselves, and they were locked in prison. After years of court procedures, Bhagat Singh, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru, was hanged on 23rd March 1931.</p>
  <p>This shows his desire to sacrifice for the nation. He sacrificed marriage, home, comfort, and even his life for the freedom of India. Today most of us wouldn’t even sacrifice for our career, leave alone the country. The Indian youth need to learn how to sacrifice from Bhagat Singh.</p>
  <h2><b>courage</b></h2>
  <p>On 7th Oct. 1930 court announced the death sentence for Bhagat Singh and his comrades. This news shocked the nation. From 7th October to 23rd March 1931, many people tried to save Bhagat Singh and his comrades from death, but Bhagat Singh didn’t want to get saved. He wanted to die because he knew if he died, the youth would awaken from their sleep and fight against British rule. He even wrote a letter to the Punjab Governor that he was a war prisoner, so he requested them to shoot them instead of hanging them.</p>
  <p>When asked why he wanted to die, he said, “Revolutionaries have to die because the cause they represent is strengthened by sacrifice, not by an appeal in court.”</p>
  <p>On the evening of 23rd March, when other prisoners learned that the Bhagat Singh and his comrades were to be hanged on the same day, they got broken. They knew they would be hanged, but when the actual time came, they got devastated. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and Shivaram Hari Rajguru happily climbed the gallows showing the British that Indians were not afraid to die for their country. The jail authorities were amazed by the courage of these three young people; never had they seen someone climb the gallows so courageously.</p>
  <p>This is the most powerful lesson from Bhagat Singh’s life- courage. He never feared death; he had a strong purpose: freedom for India for which he would do anything.</p>
  <a name="gandhi's attitude"><h2><b><u>gandhi's attitude</u></b></h2></a>
  <p>There was no question of gandhi's approving or commending bhagat singh's killing  J.P saunders, or his  throwing bombs at the central assembly hall. his soul revolted againts such brutal deeds.because of his firm adherence to the doctrine of non-violence, which he regarded as an artical of his faith, and a passion of his existence, he could never  make the commutation of bhagat singh's death sentence a precondition for signing his pact with viceroy Irwin. subhas
      chandra bose wrote in his biography that he pleaded with the mahatma to break with the viceroy on the question of bhagat singh's death sentence .subhas chandra bose recalls:I savarkar and his associates in london for the liberation of the country from the liberation of the country from foreign rule.  </p>
      <p>when dhingra's case came to the old bailey, gandhi was in England . he sent his views on wyllie's murder for publication in the indian opinion in natal which appeared in its issue of 14 August 1909. gandhi had gone to England in a delegation to lobby for the interesrts of the transval asians, who were suffering from social discrimination, and to campaign against the notorious 'black ordinance ' requiring the registration of asiatics. </p>
      <p>during his stay in london from july 1909 to november 1909, gandhi gave serious thought to understand the motives and nature of Dhingra's action. the Dhingra case and his hanging made a profound impact on gandhi's thinking, and formation and evolution of his moral and political hilosophy. discussing the Dhingra case, and the circumstances under which he committed the murder in a state of intoxication, gandhi drew the following conclusion:</p>
      <p>I must say that those who believe and argue that such murders may do good to india are ignorant men indeed . no act of treachery can ever profit a nation. even should the british leave in consequence of such murderous acts, who will then be happy? Is the englishman bad because he is an English man? Is it that everyone with an Indian skin is good ? If that is so, we can claim no rights in south africa, nor should there be any angry protest against oppression by India can gain nothing from the rule of murders- no matter whether they are black or white. under such a rule,India will be utterly ruined and laid waste . this train of thought leads to a host of reflections, but I have no time to set them down here. I am afraid some indian's will commend this murder . I believe they will be guilty of a heinous sin. we ought to abandon such fanciful ideas.4 In his letter dated 14 october 1909 to tell the revolutionaries and everybody else that the freedom they want, is not to be obtained by killing people or doing violence but by becoming and remaining truly Indian. </p>
